# SDG pass 2, protocol v1: SDG 2, Zero Hunger

What the SDG pass 2 question (`../sdg_pass2_v3.md`) tells the model about
this goal. GOAL_SCOPE fills `{scope}`: the official title of the goal and,
for some goals, a guidance paragraph. GOAL_TARGETS fills `{targets}`: the
targets of the goal, one per line, as the target id, two spaces and the
target's title. Neither block holds a brace.

This goal has no guidance: GOAL_SCOPE holds the official title only.

The official title and the target titles are the `title` fields of the UN
Statistics Division SDG API (https://unstats.un.org/sdgapi), downloaded on
2026-10-08, with runs of whitespace collapsed to one space.

First run in `open_alex_adt_gate`. Status: frozen, protocol v1 (2026-10-08),
revision 3. The goal's id has the prefix `sdggoal-02` and is listed in
`../../../IDS.tsv`.

Licence: the official title and the targets are those of the United Nations
and keep their source's terms (`CREDITS.md`); the rest is CC BY 4.0
(https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), see `LICENSE-DATA.md`.

Only the fenced `text` blocks under the `## NAME` headings below count
toward the prompt id; this header does not. The blocks are byte for byte
those of the earlier runs and are never edited: a changed wording is a new
question under a new name.
